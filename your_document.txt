=== GENERATIVE AI ===

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content such as text, images, audio, and video based on patterns learned from training data.
Large Language Models (LLMs) are the foundation of generative AI. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini.
Generative AI works by predicting the next token or word based on the input context it receives.
Popular generative AI applications include chatbots, code assistants, image generators, and content creation tools.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs to get better outputs from generative AI models.
Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to make it perform better on a specific task.
Hallucination in AI refers to when a model generates confident but incorrect or fabricated information.
Tokens are the basic units of text that LLMs process. One token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words.
Temperature in AI controls randomness of output. Low temperature gives focused answers, high temperature gives creative answers.
Zero-shot prompting means asking the model to perform a task without any examples.
Few-shot prompting means providing a few examples in the prompt to guide the model's response.
Chain of thought prompting encourages the model to think step by step before giving a final answer.
AI agents are systems that use LLMs to autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks.
Multimodal AI models can process and generate multiple types of content such as text, images, and audio together.
Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic, designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest.
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, developed by OpenAI.

Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
Semantic search uses embeddings to find content based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.

=== RAG (RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION) ===

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation.
RAG allows AI models to answer questions using your own custom documents and knowledge base.
The RAG pipeline has two main phases: the indexing phase and the retrieval phase.
In the indexing phase, documents are loaded, split into chunks, converted to embeddings, and stored in a vector database.
In the retrieval phase, the user query is embedded, similar chunks are retrieved, and the LLM generates an answer using those chunks.
Chunking is the process of splitting large documents into smaller pieces for better retrieval accuracy.
Chunk size typically ranges from 200 to 1000 characters depending on the use case.
Chunk overlap ensures that context is not lost at the boundaries of chunks.
Vector databases store embeddings and enable fast similarity search. Examples include ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant.
ChromaDB is an open source vector database that runs locally and is great for development.
Pinecone is a managed cloud vector database popular for production RAG applications.
Cosine similarity is a common metric used to measure how similar two embeddings are.
Top-K retrieval means fetching the K most relevant chunks for a given query.
RAG reduces hallucinations by grounding the model's answers in real retrieved documents.
LangChain is a popular framework for building RAG pipelines and AI applications.
LlamaIndex is another framework specialized for building RAG and document question answering systems.
Hybrid search combines keyword search and semantic search for better retrieval results.
Re-ranking is the process of reordering retrieved chunks by relevance before passing them to the LLM.
Sentence transformers are models used to convert text into embeddings for semantic search.
The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is a lightweight and fast sentence transformer model popular for local embeddings.
